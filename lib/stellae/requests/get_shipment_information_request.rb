    # Please note, due to the heavy processing required by this request,
    # we limit to a maximum of 3 days if you donâ€™t specify an order number.'

    # Per Don: 'there is one "funny" in that we don't allow over 14 day range if you don't
    # supply an order number.  if you do a larger range, we take the ending date and
    # subtract 14 days to get the starting date.'
